**I want to know - Benjamin Anderson**


You're alone in the rain
Been thinking of you
You can't stop your tears
When you stayed with me just before
I want to know
Do you love me?

How long you had to wait for me
You can't think of yesterday
I got in a fight

When you saw me
but I couldn't talk and sprawled out on the floor
So it's too late

Oh Girl, How can I speak with you?
If you could hear my secret
Now I really want to talk
It's a shame
oh,did you know?
There's a way that you can find what you seek
You'll be stronger for real.
